 # Mrjob
 
 mrjob is the easiest route to writing Python programs that run on Hadoop. If you use mrjob, you’ll be able to test your code locally without installing Hadoop or run it on a cluster of your choice.

Additionally, mrjob has extensive integration with Amazon Elastic MapReduce. Once you’re set up, it’s as easy to run your job in the cloud as it is to run it on your laptop.

Here are a number of features of mrjob that make writing MapReduce jobs easier:

Keep all MapReduce code for one job in a single class
Easily upload and install code and data dependencies at runtime
Switch input and output formats with a single line of code
Automatically download and parse error logs for Python tracebacks
Put command line filters before or after your Python code
If you don’t want to be a Hadoop expert but need the computing power of MapReduce, mrjob might be just the thing for you.
